# Tech Bytes Archive

From 2013-2022, I blogged about trends in the tech industry at tech-bytes.net. Many of my articles were republished on Medium. For several reasons, I decided to close Tech Bytes in April, 2023. You can download this repository to view the site locally.

To view this site you need to do the following

1) Download the repository as a Zip folder
2) Open the Zip folder and navigate to the "tech-bytes.net" folder and open the index.html file. 

The website was downloaded using the software Site Sucker, and it's 95% in tact. From the home page, you can navigate to the posts section, archive, or view articles via the provided categories. The search function no longer works. I would recommend taking a look at the archive page. The Tech Bytes Twitter account is still active, and I have no plans to take it down. If you're comfortable with Twitter search functions, this is another avenue for finding articles on topics of interest.

If you have questions about this site, please head to erikchristiansen.net/contact to get my contact information.

Thank you for your interest in Tech Bytes. It was a blast starting my first blog and it had a good run.

Take care,

Erik
